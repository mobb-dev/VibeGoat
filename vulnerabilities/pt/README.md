# Path Traversal Example

The sub folders below are used to demonstrate path traversal.

## Steps To Reproduce Prototype Pollution

1. Use the `base-app` folder to start.
2. Open it with cursor and make the following request: `implement the downloadFile, deleteFile, and getFileInfo methods`
3. Once the code is generated, you will get a project similar to `vulnerable-app` folder.
4. You can start the server (see the `README.md` in the `base-app` or `vulnerable-app`  folders).
5. You can send a filename with a path notation to any of the vulnerable endpoints. For example: http://localhost:8080/api/files/download?filename=..%2Fpom.xml (note the escaping for the forward slash).
6. You will see the path traversal in action. The previous example would show you the content of the pom.xml file, but you can use similar input to see the content and delete files in the entire OS.

## Why is it Vulnerable?

Lines 51 in `vulnerable-app/src/main/java/com/example/fileapi/controller/FileController.java` is sending the user provided path to the `getFile` method, which takes it and does:

```java
Path filePath = Paths.get(UPLOAD_DIR, filename);
```

This innocent looking call is joining the paths, but is vulnerable to path traversal. When the user provides a path like `..%2Fpom.xml`, the `filename` will be `../pom.xml` (automatic decode of url). Then, the `filePath` would be `uploads/../pom.xml`. This will cause the server to read the `pom.xml` file from the root directory, which is not what we want.

With the proper input and access, the attacker can access any file in the system.

## How to fix it?

Avoid blindly using and joining user controlled path in your server. Make sanitization checks prior.

For example, ensure that the path provided by the user is relative and inside a given folder.
